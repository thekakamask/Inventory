//InventoryDatabase is the central class of the Room database.
//It provides a singleton instance of the database via `getDatabase()`, and exposes the necessary DAOs,
//here `itemDao()`, to interact with the `Item` table.
// This class uses Room to:
//- Access local data (via the DAO).
//- Insert, modify, or delete `Item` objects.
//- Persist data even after the application is closed.

//Whenever i change the database table schema, i need to increase the version number.
//i don't keep the schema in the version history.

    //The companion object will allow access to the methods for creating or generating the database
    // and which will use the class name as a qualifier.
    // The Instance variable will hold a reference to the database.
    // This way, only one instance of the database is open at a time.
    // the Instance var is Volatile so its value will be always up to date and identical for all execution threads.
    // All writing or reading will be from main memory (never put in cache).

        // instead of throwing an exception (âš  only useful in development).
