# 📚 **Inventory**
**Inventory** is a modern Android application that allows users to manage a local inventory including adding, editing, selling, and deleting items. This app demonstrates the use of modern Jetpack components including **Room**, **ViewModel**, **StateFlow**, and **Navigation**, and follows the **MVVM** architecture pattern. It leverages **Kotlin Coroutines** for asynchronous operations and persists data locally using an **SQLite database** via the Room persistence library.
